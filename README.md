# python-flashcard-app

This is a simple app of Flashcard to help in the Portuguese / English studies implemented using Tkinter package.

The Portuguese / English are generated automatically by importing the 1000 most common words in Portuguese (see https://github.com/hermitdave/FrequencyWords/blob/master/content/2018/pt_br/pt_br_50k.txt) and translating automatically on Google Sheets by using the GOOGLETRANSLATE function. Any translation mistakes are Google's fault ;).
